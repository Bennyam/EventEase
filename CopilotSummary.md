# EventEase — Copilot Summary (Activities 1–3)

This repository contains a Blazor WebAssembly demo app built and refined with the help of Microsoft Copilot. Below is a concise summary of how Copilot accelerated each step.

## How Copilot helped

### Activity 1 — Foundations

- **Scaffolded components**: Generated an `EventCard` component (fields, two-way binding) and page skeletons.
- **Routing**: Suggested correct `@page` directives and navigation links between `/events`, `/events/{id}`, and `/events/{id}/register`.
- **Mock data**: Drafted an `EventService` with in-memory data for quick iteration.

### Activity 2 — Debug & Optimize

- **Validation fixes**: Added DataAnnotations and `EditForm` validation (`ValidationSummary`, `ValidationMessage`) to prevent bad input/binding errors.
- **Routing robustness**: Introduced `ErrorBoundary` and a friendly `NotFound` page; added guards for unknown IDs.
- **Performance**: Replaced `foreach` with `<Virtualize>` and added `@key` to improve rendering for large lists.
- **Diagnostics**: Inserted structured logging via `ILogger` for `GetAll/Add/Update/Delete` flows.

### Activity 3 — Advanced Features

- **Registration form**: Generated a validated `Registration` model + `RegistrationService` and a page that posts registrations.
- **Session state**: Implemented a lightweight `SessionService` to track current user and last registered event.
- **Attendance tracking**: Added counts per event and an `Attendance` page listing attendees.

## Example Copilot prompts

- “Create a Blazor component that edits an Event with EditForm, two-way binding, and Save callback.”
- “Add DataAnnotations validation with ValidationSummary and field-level ValidationMessage.”
- “Replace a foreach list with Blazor `<Virtualize>` including @key, ItemSize, OverscanCount.”
- “Implement a RegistrationService with in-memory storage and logging.”

## Outcomes

- Faster iteration from skeletons/snippets.
- Fewer bugs via suggested validation and routing patterns.
- Better responsiveness and maintainability ready for deployment.
